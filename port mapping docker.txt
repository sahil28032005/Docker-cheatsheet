:port mapping:
//as we know containers are isolated hence ports inside container cant workk directly on local environment of computer
//for running in local envoronment we have to expose the ports

commds:
-docker run -it -p 1025:1025 (command used for export port on local side actually where port before : represents machines port on which that port get exposed and after colen port no will represent actual port running in that image on that port)
-docker run -it -p 5000:1025 containername(maps on local machines 5000 port)
-docker run -it -p 5000:1025 -e key=value -e kay=value (for sending environment variables to container)
